##  Features

###  Dataset Generator  
Generate fully customizable synthetic datasets for your machine learning projects or API testing with just a few inputs.  
- Choose the number of samples you need.  
- Define your own schema â€” column names, data types (e.g., string, integer, date, category).  
- Get downloadable datasets in CSV, JSON nad zip formats.  
- Great for prototyping, testing algorithms, or filling in missing data.

###  Dataset Balancer  

ML models often fail to generalize well when trained on imbalanced datasets.  
Devmateâ€™s Dataset Balancer helps you fix that using:  
- **Oversampling:** Generates synthetic examples for underrepresented classes using techniques like SMOTE or random duplication.  
- **Undersampling:** Reduces samples from dominant classes to balance the ratio.  
- **Visual Class Distribution:** Quickly visualize before and after balance.  
- Useful in classification tasks like fraud detection, medical diagnosis, sentiment analysis, etc.

### âš™ Code Optimizer  
Struggling with messy, unoptimized code? Let Devmate fix it for you.  
- Paste in your Python, JavaScript, or pseudo-code.  
- The optimizer detects inefficient patterns and restructures them for better performance.  
- Applies improvements like:
  - Loop unrolling
  - Removing redundant code
  - Improving time and space complexity
